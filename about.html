            <h2>My Story
                
                <br><br>I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Business Management at Louisiana State University and my Master’s degree in Education from Liberty University. I have about 10 years experience working in different business departments from Human Resources, Accounting, and IT. I also have 5 years experience in Education as a School Counselor. Building relationships, empowering others, and facilitating efficiency through process improvements have been consistent initiatives I’ve excelled in throughout my professional career.  I'm looking forward to bringing these skills to the design process to create products that benefit both the business and the user. 

            Studying UX Design at CareerFoundry has given me insight into how to bring these various experiences and what they’ve taught me to the design process. For example, being a very detailed, strategic person with a high level of empathy for others allows me to understand both the business requirements and the needs of the user. I like thinking outside the box to create products that make productivity and lifestyle satisfaction a reality for others.
